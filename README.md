First, we downloaded our datasets and examined the number of rows and columns, as well as reviewed the column headers. Next, we proceeded with data cleaning, where we eliminated variables (columns) that were infrequently used by the employees in the building.
Next, since our project focuses on a classification model with five classes—Outdoor Air Temperature Sensor Bias, Supply Air Temperature Sensor Bias, OA Damper, Cooling Coil Valve, and Fault-Free—we chose to explore the raw data based on fault intensity. For example, sensor readings were grouped together, and fault intensities were combined with their corresponding percentages. We then compared these results to the Fault-Free dataset.
